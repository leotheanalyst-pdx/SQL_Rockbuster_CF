Data Analytics project for Career Foundry. Analysis of Rockbuster Stealth's online movie rental database to provide insights for a 2020 company launch strategy.

## **Objective**
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company hoping to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in 2020.

## **Data**
Rockbuster has a relational database composed of 14 tables of data: payment, rental, store, film_actor, inventory, film_category, customer, staff, language, actor, film, category, address, city, country. An ERD was created as a part of this analysis.

## **Tools**
### Language: PostgresSQL
### Software: pgAmin, DbVisualizer, Tableau, Excel, PowerPoint
